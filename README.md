## ü§ñ How It Works

This project combines a modern Angular frontend with an intelligent serverless backend.

1.  **User Request**: The player selects a difficulty and requests a new game from the Angular frontend.
2.  **API Call**: The frontend sends a request to a Vercel Serverless Function.
3.  **AI Puzzle Generation**: The serverless function acts as a secure backend that calls the **Google Gemini API**. It provides a detailed system prompt instructing the AI to act as a Rush Hour puzzle expert.
4.  **Structured Response**: The AI is instructed to return a puzzle that is guaranteed to be valid, solvable, and in a specific JSON format.
5.  **Game Setup**: The frontend receives the JSON data and dynamically builds the game board, placing the vehicles in their starting positions.
